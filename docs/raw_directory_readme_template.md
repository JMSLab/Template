### Overview
Provide a brief overview of the purpose of the directory.

### Source
Give contact information, url, etc. for the source of the data.

### When/where obtained & original form of files
Give detailed information on when the files were obtained, how they were obtained (e.g., downloaded from www.xxx.edu, by e-mail, on a hard drive, etc.), and the form they came in (e.g., a single zip archive called "rawdata.zip"). The goal is that anyone who follows these instructions exactly and has the right access should be able to obtain the dataset.

### Description
Briefly describe the contents of the subdirectories and files. You do not necessarily need to describe each file separately, but a user should be able to look at the directory and understand the organization and purpose of the files.

### Terms of Use
What are the terms or restrictions for using the data or publishing findings? Either state these here or state where they can be found within this directory.

### Notes
Note anything else you think we should record about the raw data.
